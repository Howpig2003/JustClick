# Click Counter Project

## Project Overview
This project is a simple click counter application developed to practice the ASP.NET Core MVC framework. Through this project, I explored core concepts such as controllers, views, models, database operations, and routing configuration.

## Features
- **Click Tracking**: Users can click a button, and the system records the click count via AJAX and updates the display.
- **Information Display**: Shows the total click count, last click time, and application name.
- **Data Persistence**: Uses SQLite database to store click records, ensuring data persists across application restarts.

## Technologies
- **Framework**: ASP.NET Core MVC (.NET 6)
- **Database**: SQLite, integrated with Entity Framework Core for data access
- **Frontend**: Bootstrap 4.5.2 (styling), jQuery 3.5.1 (AJAX requests)
- **Languages**: C#, HTML, JavaScript
- **Tools**: Visual Studio, Entity Framework Core migration tools

## AI Usage
This project was developed with assistance from **Grok 3** (provided by xAI), which helped answer technical questions, provide code examples, and optimize the project structure, particularly in routing configuration, database migrations, and model design.
